    "- **Certain Event**: An event that is sure to happen (e.g., rolling a number between 1 and 6 on a fair die).\n",
    "- **Impossible Event**: An event that cannot happen (e.g., rolling a 7 on a fair die).\n",
    "- **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Events that cannot occur simultaneously (e.g., rolling a 2 and a 5 at the same time).\n"
